<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I’m Nethaji Madhivanan, a second-year Computer Science and Engineering student at Anna University, Chennai. I’m someone who balances creativity and logic, diving deep into coding, algorithms, and technical problem-solving while nurturing my passion for poetry and storytelling. I enjoy playing chess, writing thought-provoking quotes, and exploring new ideas in both technology and art. With a goal to secure an internship soon, I aspire to grow in my field and release my own poetic book, blending my love for literature and innovation into something meaningful.</p>

<p>As a curious learner, I’m fascinated by cutting-edge fields like quantum computing, which inspires me to think beyond conventional boundaries. I believe in the power of persistence and creativity to solve problems, whether it’s designing software or crafting a compelling narrative. My journey is driven by the desire to contribute to both the technical and creative worlds, creating meaningful impacts in my own unique way.</p>

<p>I take pride in my ability to express complex ideas simply, making them accessible and engaging for others. Whether it’s a technical explanation, a poetic verse, or a well-thought-out chess strategy, I love seeing how every skill and interest I pursue adds a new layer to my perspective. I’m always eager to learn, improve, and take on challenges that push me closer to my aspirations.</p>
